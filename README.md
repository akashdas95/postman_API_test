## Overview
In this repository, you’ll find a collection of Postman collections that cover various types of API tests, including:
* GET requests to retrieve data
* POST requests to send data to the server
* PUT/PATCH requests to update data
* DELETE requests to remove data
#### Additionally, the collections are organized into different folders based on API functionality and endpoints, making it easy to test specific features or services.
## API Collections
Each collection represents a different API or set of related endpoints. Below are the key collections available:
### User Authentication API
This collection contains tests for user authentication endpoints (e.g., login, logout, token refresh).
### User API
Test endpoints related to the user management (e.g., adding, updating, deleting user).
